# DokerFiles
## The one-stop shop for relatively unnecessary and overly-personalized Dockerfiles

My repository for Dockerfiles and associated other files.

Each branch of the repository holds the development branch of the Dockerfile associated with the branch name, i.e. the ros branch holds the dev branch of the ros-dock Dockerfile, etc.

The master branch is connected to automated building on Docker Hub.
