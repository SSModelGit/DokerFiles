# DokerFiles
## The one-stop shop for relatively unnecessary and overly-personalized Dockerfiles

My repository for Dockerfiles and associated other files.

This was supposed to just be a personal repo to host my shoddy hacks of Dockerfiles, but it seems like I'll be hosting the CompArch f2020 Docker stuff for a bit. If you're here for that, please head to the wiki located [here](wiki).

The master branch is connected to automated building on Docker Hub.
